		<introtext><![CDATA[<strong>Graphic design</strong> is the art of communication, stylizing, and problem-solving through the use of type, space, and image. <br /><br />The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used interchangeably with these due to overlapping skills involved. Graphic designers use various methods to create and combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. <br /><br />A graphic designer may use a combination of typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce a final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.<br /><br />Common uses of graphic design include identity (logos and branding), publications (magazines, newspapers and books), print advertisements, posters, billboards, website graphics and elements, signs and product packaging. <br /><br />For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as images, shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design, especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.<br /><div style="float: right;">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a></div>]]></introtext>

		<introtext><![CDATA[In marketing, lead generation is the generation of consumer interest or inquiry into products or services of a business. <br /><br />Leads can be generated for purposes such as list building, e-newsletter list acquisition or for sales leads. The methods for generating leads typically fall under the umbrella of advertising, but may also include non-paid sources such as organic search engine results or referrals from existing customers. <br /><br />Businesses strive to generate "quality" leads. Quality is usually determined by the propensity of the inquirer to take the next action towards a purchase.<br /><br />Lead generation is the process of creating sales leads which might convert into sale for the company. The leads may come from various sources or activities, for example, digitally via the Internet, through calls, through advertisement and list purchase. Companies may also rely on referrals, telemarketers, and advertisements to generate leads. Lead Generation is a very popular practice of generating leads in the Business to Business type of sales. <br /><br />Lead Generation, unlike Demand Generation, is more about actual opportunities (Leads) than creating awareness or demand.<br /><div style="float: right;">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_generation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a></div>]]></introtext>

		<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Strategy (Greek "στρατηγία"—stratēgia, "art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship") is a high level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty. Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve these goals are usually limited.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as "a pattern in a stream of decisions" to contrast with a view of strategy as planning while Max McKeown (2011) argues that "strategy is about shaping the future" and is the human attempt to get to "desirable ends with available means". Dr. Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as "a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully."</p><div style="text-align: right;">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a></div>]]></introtext>

The interrogation of experience has a long tradition in continental philosophy.</p><p>Experience plays an important role in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. The German term Erfahrung, often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of lifes experiences. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert.</p>Certain religious traditions (such as types of Buddhism, Surat Shabd Yoga, mysticism and Pentecostalism) and educational paradigms with, for example, the conditioning of military recruit-training (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human epistemology. <br /><br />This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of dogma, logic or reasoning. Participants in activities such as tourism, extreme sports and recreational drug-use also tend to stress the importance of experience.<p style="text-align: right;">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>.</p>]]></fulltext>

		<fulltext><![CDATA[<p>Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns). Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below).</p><p>In some cases the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, cowboy coding and graphic design) is also considered to be design. More formally design has been defined as follows. (noun) a specification of an object, manifested by an agent, intended to accomplish goals, in a particular environment, using a set of primitive components.</p><p>Satisfying a set of requirements, subject to constraints; (verb, transitive) to create a design, in an environment (where the designer operates), another definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective.</p><p>Here, a "specification" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and "primitives" are the elements from which the design object is composed. With such a broad denotation, there is no universal language or unifying institution for designers of all disciplines. This allows for many differing philosophies and approaches toward the subject (see Philosophies and studies of design, below).</p><p>The person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas, usually also specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a fashion designer, concept designer or web designer). A designers sequence of activities is called a design process.</p><p>The scientific study of design is called design science. Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes and even methods of designing.</p><div style="text-align: right;">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>.</div>]]></fulltext>
